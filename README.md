# Face-Mask-Detection

Face mask detection is an image analytics technology powered by python and computer vision that addresses Covid-19 noncompliance.
Face mask Detection System mainly aims to: 
• Improved affine transformation is developed to crop the facial areas from uncontrolled real-time images having differences in face size, orientation and background. This step helps in better localizing the person who is violating the facemask norms in public 
areas/ offices.
• Creation of unbiased facemask dataset with imbalance ratio equals to nearly one.
• The proposed model requires less memory, making it easily deployable for embedded devices used for surveillance purposes.
